Cyber Attack Detection using Unsupervised LearningIn this project, we used unsupervised learning techniques to visualize and identify the four different types of cyberattacks categorized as Masquerade, Poisoning, Injection, and ReplayThe source code is included in the `index.ipynb` file of this directory.Methodology Used->EDA->Feature Engineering->Binary and Multi-Class Attack DetectionHow to Run->Upload the four `train.csv`,`test.csv` and the `index.ipynb` on Kaggle or Google Colab and change the file paths of uploaded files accordingly.->Allocate Runtime->Run all cells to get the desired visualization and performance metrics in the output section.Models and Techniques Used->K-Means->GMM->DBSCAN->Hierarchical Clustering->Isolation ForestTeam and MembersKaggle Team Name : Jarvis->Bhimana Venkata Narasimham (25947)->Sagnika Mukhopadhyay (26542)->Shreya Ghosh(25822)
