Contributor Verification Using ML TechniquesIn this project, we predicted whether a given candidate is a true contributor of the article or not using Machine Learning.The source code is included in the `index.ipynb` file of this directory.Methodology Used->Data Preprocessing->Negative Sampling->Feature EngineeringOutputThe output of the `index.ipynb` is a `submission.csv` that contains the predictions (0/1) for each 'articleid' in the format id and label.How to Run->Upload the `train.json`,`test.json` and the `index.ipynb` on Kaggle or Google Colab.->Allocate Runtime->Run all cells to get the desired `submission.csv` in the output section.Models and Techniques Used->Logistic Regression->LGBM->Neural Networks->Ensemble ModelDependencies->numpy->pandas->scikit-learn->tenserflow->sklearn->matplotlib->lightgbmTeam and MembersKaggle Team Name : Jarvis->Bhimana Venkata Narasimham (25947)->Sagnika Mukhopadhyay (26542)->Shreya Ghosh(25822)
